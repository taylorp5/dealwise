# Negotiation Examples

This document contains real-world examples of car buying negotiations that can be used as reference for the Dealership Copilot app.

## Example 1: Initial Price Negotiation

**Scenario:** 2022 Toyota Corolla SE, listed at $25,000, 25,000 miles

**User's Script (Professional Tone):**
```
Hi [Dealer Name],

I'm interested in the 2022 Toyota Corolla SE you have listed. I've done some research and found similar vehicles in the area priced between $22,000-$23,500. 

Given the mileage and current market conditions, I'd like to discuss a fair price. Would you be open to negotiating around $23,000 out-the-door?

I'm ready to move forward quickly if we can reach an agreement.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Dealer Response:**
```
Thanks for your interest! I understand you've been shopping around. The price is already competitive, but I can work with you. The best I can do is $24,500 OTD. This is a great deal for a low-mileage Corolla in excellent condition.

When would you like to come in for a test drive?
```

**Interpretation:**
- Dealer is willing to negotiate (dropped from $25k to $24.5k)
- Using urgency tactic ("great deal")
- Pushing for in-person visit (test drive)
- Still room for negotiation

## Example 2: Counter-Offer After Initial Response

**Scenario:** Dealer offered $24,500, user wants to counter

**User's Counter-Offer (Firm Tone):**
```
Thank you for the offer. I appreciate you working with me, but $24,500 is still above market value for similar vehicles I've seen.

I've found comparable Corollas at $23,200-$23,800. I'm prepared to offer $23,500 OTD, which I believe is fair for both of us.

I'm ready to finalize today if we can agree on this price. Otherwise, I'll need to continue shopping.

Let me know your thoughts.
```

**Key Points:**
- References market research
- Sets clear bottom line
- Creates urgency ("ready to finalize today")
- Shows willingness to walk away

## Example 3: Requesting More Information

**Scenario:** User wants vehicle history before negotiating

**User's Script (Friendly Tone):**
```
Hi there,

I'm very interested in the 2022 Corolla SE. Before we discuss pricing, I'd like to get some additional information:

1. Can you provide the vehicle's full service history?
2. Has the car been in any accidents, even minor ones?
3. Are there any known issues or upcoming maintenance needs?
4. Can I see a Carfax report?

I want to make sure this is the right vehicle before we move forward. Once I have this information, I'm ready to make a decision quickly.

Thanks for your help!
```

## Example 4: Dealer Using Pressure Tactics

**Dealer Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out because we have another buyer very interested in this vehicle. They're coming in tomorrow to look at it, and if they like it, it will be gone.

I can hold it for you if you can come in today and put down a deposit. The price is firm at $24,500, but I can throw in floor mats and a full tank of gas.

This is a limited-time offer. Let me know ASAP!
```

**Red Flags:**
- ⚠️ False urgency ("another buyer")
- ⚠️ Pressure to decide immediately
- ⚠️ "Limited-time offer" language
- ⚠️ Asking for deposit before negotiation

**Suggested Response:**
```
Thanks for the update. I understand you have other interested parties, but I need to complete my due diligence first.

If the vehicle is still available after I've reviewed the service history and had a mechanic inspection, I'm happy to discuss terms. However, I can't commit to a deposit without seeing the car and verifying its condition.

I'm still interested, but I won't be rushed into a decision. Please let me know if the vehicle becomes available again.
```

## Example 5: Multiple Offers Comparison

**Scenario:** User has 3 offers from different dealers

**Offer 1:**
- Dealer: ABC Motors
- Price: $23,800 OTD
- Notes: Includes 1-year warranty, recent service records available

**Offer 2:**
- Dealer: XYZ Auto
- Price: $23,500 OTD
- Notes: No warranty, higher mileage (30k), some cosmetic wear

**Offer 3:**
- Dealer: Best Cars
- Price: $24,200 OTD
- Notes: Certified pre-owned, full warranty, excellent condition

**Analysis:**
- Best value: Offer 2 (lowest price, but trade-offs)
- Best overall: Offer 3 (certified, warranty, condition)
- Middle ground: Offer 1 (good price with warranty)

## Example 6: Negotiating Fees

**Scenario:** Dealer adds unexpected fees

**User's Response:**
```
I see you've added several fees:
- Documentation fee: $500
- Dealer prep: $300
- Advertising fee: $200

I wasn't aware of these fees when we discussed the $23,500 price. These seem high compared to other dealers I've spoken with.

Can you explain what these fees cover, and is there any flexibility on them? I'd like to keep the total OTD price at $23,500 as we discussed.

Thanks for your understanding.
```

## Example 7: Finalizing the Deal

**User's Closing Script:**
```
Great! I'm ready to move forward at $23,500 OTD. Before we finalize, I want to confirm:

1. The price includes all taxes, fees, and registration
2. The vehicle will be detailed and ready for pickup
3. All service records will be provided
4. The car will have a full tank of gas

I can come in [day/time] to complete the paperwork. Please send over the final breakdown so I can review it before I arrive.

Looking forward to finalizing this!
```

   - Understand typical fees in your area

2. **Be Professional but Firm**
   - Stay respectful
   - Set clear boundaries
   - Don't be afraid to walk away

3. **Create Urgency (When Appropriate)**
   - "I'm ready to buy today if we can agree on price"

6. **Be Willing to Walk Away**
   - Don't let pressure tactics work
   - There are always other cars
   - Your best negotiating tool is your ability to leave

## Common Dealer Tactics to Watch For

- **"Limited time offer"** - Creates false urgency
- **"Another buyer is interested"** - May or may not be true
- **"Manager approval needed"** - Delays to make you wait
- **"This is our best price"** - Usually not true
- **Adding fees at the last minute** - Bait and switch
- **Pushing for immediate decision** - Prevents you from shopping around

## Red Flags in Dealer Communications

- Pressure to decide immediately
- Unwillingness to provide vehicle history
- Vague answers to specific questions
- Adding unexpected fees
- Refusing to put terms in writing
- Aggressive or pushy language
- Unrealistic promises or guarantees

Each one includes:

- **Context**
- **User’s Input / Dealer Message**
- **What the user is trying to do**
- **How the AI should respond (desired behavior)**

## **Example 1: Dealer refusing to provide OTD price**

**Context:** User emailed dealership asking for OTD price.

**Dealer Message:**

> “We don’t give out the OTD price unless you come into the dealership. But the listed price is $25,500.”
> 

**User Goal:** Get OTD price remotely.

**AI Should Output:**

- Identify this as a pressure tactic
- Explain to user that this is common and not acceptable
- Provide a firm but polite reply
- Avoid confrontation

**Expected AI Response Style:**

“Thanks! I’m finalizing numbers with multiple dealerships remotely. To move forward, I’ll need the full OTD price. Please include taxes, doc fee, and any add-ons.”

## **Example 2: Dealer giving monthly payment instead of price**

**Dealer Message:**

> “We can get you into this car for only $389/month!”
> 

**User Goal:** Avoid monthly-payment trap.

**AI Should Output:**

- Explain tactic
- Re-center conversation around OTD
- Provide firm reply

**Expected AI Response:**

“I’m only evaluating Out-The-Door pricing at the moment. Can you please send the total OTD price including all taxes and fees?”

## **Example 3: Price listed as “market adjusted”**

**Dealer Message:**

> “This model has a $3,000 market adjustment due to demand.”
> 

**User Goal:** Push back on markup.

**AI Should Output:**

- Explain market adjustment
- Provide diplomatic reply
- Suggest counteroffer if reasonable

**Expected AI Response:**

“I’m not considering market adjustments in my offer. What is your best OTD price without the added markup?”

## **Example 4: Dealer adds unnecessary add-ons**

**Dealer Message:**

> “We include paint protection, window tint, VIN etching, and nitrogen-filled tires for $1,299.”
> 

**User Goal:** Remove add-ons.

**AI Should Output:**

- Identify negotiable/optional fees

**Expected AI Response:**

“I’m not interested in the dealer-installed add-ons. Please provide the OTD price without those items.”

## **Example 5: Dealer gives a high doc fee**

**Dealer Message:**

> “Doc fee is $499, which is required.”
> 

**User Goal:** Understand doc fee & negotiate total price.

**AI Should Output:**

- Explain doc fees vary by state
- Suggest focusing on OTD, not individual line items

**Expected AI Response:**

“Doc fees vary, so let’s focus on the total number. What’s your best OTD price including everything?”

## **Example 6: Lowballing the user on trade-in**

**Dealer Message:**

> “We can give you $5,000 for your trade-in.”
> 

**User Goal:** Push back politely.

**AI Should Output:**

**Expected AI Response:**

“I was expecting a little higher based on KBB. Here’s what I’m seeing — is there any room to improve that?”

## **Example 7: Dealer says “This offer is only good today”**

**Dealer Message:**

> “Price is only valid today. We have other buyers interested.”
> 

**User Goal:** Remove false urgency.

**AI Should Output:**

- Explain pressure tactic
- Give calm, neutral reply

**Expected AI Response:**

“I won’t be able to come in today, but if the price changes I understand. If you’d like to move forward, my target is _____ OTD.”

## **Example 8: Dealer sends vague quote**

**Dealer Message:**

> “Your price will be around $27,000 depending on taxes and fees.”
> 

**User Goal:** Get real numbers.

**AI Should Output:**

- Flag vagueness
- Request specifics

**Expected AI Response:**

“For clarity, could you provide the exact OTD price including tax, doc fee, title, and registration?”

## **Example 10: Dealer actually gives a strong offer**

**Dealer Message:**
